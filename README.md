# Java Spring core
The target of this exercise is to practice Spring core with Java 17.

## Features
- Component scanning
- Annotations and DI with @Service @Autowired @Bean @Configuration @Value
- Read raws from CSV file
- Unit and SVC tests

## Tests
Tests were written mainly to verify that context was built successfully with all beans included.
Some of the tests mix those validations with business validations. Please understand, I am just learning Spring-core.
